# This file prevents Docker from creating cookies.txt as a directory.
#
# HOW TO GENERATE COOKIES:
#
# Method 1: Browser Extension (Recommended)
# 1. Install "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" extension
#    - Chrome: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc
#    - Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/
# 2. Login to YouTube in that browser
# 3. Click extension icon -> Export
# 4. Save as cookies.txt in project root
#
# Method 2: yt-dlp
#    yt-dlp --cookies-from-browser chrome "https://youtube.com" --print-to-file "%(cookies)s" cookies.txt
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Use a DEDICATED Google account (not your personal one)
# - DON'T use that browser/account for YouTube after exporting (causes cookie rotation)
# - Cookies last 3-6 months - refresh when downloads fail
#
# See README.md for more details.
